# Second Virial Coefficients for Different Potentials
## Hard-Sphere Potential
In the hard-sphere potential model, particles can only interact in an isolated volume. There are no attractive interactions, so B2V should always be positive and be unaffected by temperature.

## Square-Well Potential
In the square-well model, B2V dependent on the temperature since at lower temperatures, the attractive interactions promote clustering. As temperature increases, B2V appraoches the hard-sphere value.

## Lennard-Jones Potential
The Lennard-Jones model is also temperature dependent. At lower tempatures, B2V will be negative since the attractive part is much stronger. As temperature increases, B2V increases as well until it becomes postive.

## Comparison
- **Hard sphere:** purely repulsive, constant positive B2V
- **Square well:** sharp transition between repulsion and attraction, producing strongly negative B2V at lower T
- **Lennard-Jones:** realistic balance of repulsion and attraction, with a smooth crossover from negative
to positive B2V
